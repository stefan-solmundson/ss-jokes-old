one night. He began to speak in a soft and steady voice over the loud-

Right – now there was this man who had just got married and was spending
his wedding night with his new wife in a very posh hotel. It was to be
the first time that he had ever had sex with his partner, indeed he had
never seen her with no clothes on. As they were both undressing, he
looked up from taking his socks off to notice that she did in fact have
completely huge breasts. He said as much to her, but the poor girl who
had always had a bit of a complex about them got very distraught at this.
So much so that she sent him with a blanket to go and sleep in the
corridor.
The man was pretty upset at this, but not wishing to fuel her anger
further, did as he was told. Just as he was getting off to sleep
another man came into the corridor to join him. The first man asked
the second why he was out there, to which he replied that he was also
on his wedding night and had never had the pleasure of seeing his new
wife’s body before either. When she was undressing, he had suddenly
exclaimed out loud what an absolutely enormous bum she had got. She
hadn’t really been very impressed with this outburst, and had ordered
him to go and sleep in the corridor.
It wasn’t long before jilted honeymooner number three sulkily sauntered
along to join the other two. “What’s wrong with you?” asked the
first, “did you put your foot in it as well?”
“No,” replied the third, “but I bloddy well could have done”
